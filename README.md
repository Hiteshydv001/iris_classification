# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

The classification of iris flowers is a fundamental machine learning problem. This project showcases how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model for this task using Python and popular machine learning libraries. This project is an example of a machine learning classification task to identify three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal characteristics. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset often used for machine learning tutorials and demonstrations.


## Dataset Used

**Dataset from kaggle:** 

We used the Iris dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
## Roadmap

**1. Data Collection:**

Gather data containing wine features (e.g., acidity, pH, alcohol content) and wine quality ratings.
Ensure data is clean, well-structured, and includes a target variable (wine quality).

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing values, outliers, and data scaling.
Select relevant features and perform feature engineering.
Encode categorical variables if needed.
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Explore data distributions, correlations, and visualizations.
Gain insights for feature selection and model building.

**4. Model Selection and Training:**

Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM).
Train initial models on the training data.
Optimize model hyperparameters for better performance.

**5. Model Evaluation:**

Evaluate model performance on the validation set using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Fine-tune models based on validation results.
